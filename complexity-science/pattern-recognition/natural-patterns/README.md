# Natural Patterns Research

## Overview
This research project aims to identify, collect, and analyze patterns that exist across multiple domains: nature, communities, organizations, and society. The goal is to better understand these patterns and how they can be leveraged in everyday life and decision-making.

## Research Questions
1. What common patterns exist across different domains (nature, communities, organizations, society)?
2. How are these patterns similar or different across domains?
3. How can these patterns be effectively categorized and understood?
4. How can we apply these patterns to solve everyday problems?

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Collection of pattern examples from various sources
- `notebooks/`: Analysis notebooks exploring patterns and their relationships
- `src/`: Any code developed for pattern analysis
- `docs/`: Documentation, literature reviews, and research findings

## Current Phase
We are currently in the **collection phase**, focusing on gathering examples of patterns from various domains.

## Collection Framework
For each pattern we collect, we will document:
1. Pattern name or identifier
2. Domain(s) where the pattern is observed
3. Description of the pattern
4. Examples of the pattern in action
5. Potential applications or insights
6. References or sources
