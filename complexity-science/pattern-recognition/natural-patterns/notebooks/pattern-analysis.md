# Pattern Analysis Framework

This document outlines approaches for analyzing the patterns we collect in our research.

## Analysis Dimensions

We'll analyze patterns across these key dimensions:

1. **Cross-Domain Presence**: How widely does a pattern appear across different domains?
   - High presence suggests fundamental/universal patterns
   - Domain-specific patterns may represent specialized adaptations

2. **Mechanism Clarity**: How well do we understand what causes the pattern?
   - Well-understood mechanisms can be more reliably applied
   - Mysterious mechanisms require more research before application

3. **Relationship Network**: How does each pattern connect to other patterns?
   - Hub patterns may represent fundamental organizing principles
   - Isolated patterns may represent unique specialized solutions

4. **Application Potential**: How easily can the pattern be applied to human problems?
   - Direct application patterns have immediate utility
   - Abstract patterns may require creative translation

## Analysis Methods

### Pattern Relationship Mapping

For each pattern we collect, we'll document:
- Which patterns it frequently co-occurs with
- Which patterns it may be a specialized case of
- Which patterns it may contain as components
- Which patterns operate at similar scales

This will allow us to create a network graph of pattern relationships.

### Cross-Domain Pattern Comparison

We'll analyze how the same pattern manifests differently across domains:
- What aspects remain consistent across domains?
- What aspects are modified by domain context?
- How do different domains "discover" the same pattern?

### Meta-Pattern Identification

As we collect patterns, we'll look for "patterns of patterns":
- Are certain types of patterns more common in certain domains?
- Do patterns follow developmental sequences?
- Are there common principles that generate multiple patterns?

### Application Mapping

For patterns with high application potential:
- Which human problems might this pattern help solve?
- What would an implementation of this pattern look like?
- What constraints or considerations apply when implementing?

## Analysis Tools

As our collection grows, we'll develop tools to assist analysis:
- Pattern database with relationship tagging
- Visualization tools for pattern networks
- Comparison matrices for cross-domain analysis
- Application opportunity maps

## Initial Analysis Questions

As we begin collecting patterns, these questions will guide our analysis:

1. Which patterns appear most consistently across all domains?
2. Which domains share the most patterns?
3. Are there patterns that appear to be unique to specific domains?
4. What are the most common underlying mechanisms across patterns?
5. Which patterns have the clearest potential for practical application?
