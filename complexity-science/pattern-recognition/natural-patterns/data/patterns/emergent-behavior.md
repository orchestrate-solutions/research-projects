# Emergent Behavior

## Domain(s)
- Nature (Physical Systems, Biological Systems)
- Communities (Online Communities, Small Group Dynamics)
- Organizations (Team Dynamics)
- Society (Social Movements, Urban Development)

## Pattern Description
Emergent behavior occurs when complex, organized patterns arise from the interactions of simpler components following simple rules, without central coordination. The resulting collective behavior cannot be predicted by examining the individual components in isolation.

## Examples
- **Nature**: Flocking birds, schooling fish, ant colonies, termite mounds, snowflake formation
- **Communities**: Spontaneous organization during crises, forum discussion threads that self-organize by topic
- **Organizations**: Informal communication networks that evolve outside the official hierarchy
- **Society**: Spontaneous public gatherings, traffic patterns, market behavior in economics

## Underlying Mechanisms
- Simple rules followed by individual agents
- Local interactions with limited information
- Feedback loops (both positive and negative)
- No central control or coordinator
- Parallel processing of interactions

## Potential Applications
- **Organizational Design**: Creating self-organizing teams by establishing simple rules rather than detailed processes
- **Community Management**: Setting minimal guidelines that allow communities to develop their own solutions
- **Problem Solving**: Distributed decision-making for complex problems
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Swarm intelligence and multi-agent systems
- **Crisis Response**: Frameworks for community self-organization during emergencies
