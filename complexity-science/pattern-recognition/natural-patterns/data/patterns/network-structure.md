# Network Structure

## Domain(s)
- Nature (Physical Systems, Biological Systems)
- Communities (Online Communities, Small Group Dynamics)
- Organizations (Communication Networks, Team Structures)
- Society (Social Networks, Economic Systems)

## Pattern Description
Network structures are patterns of connections between entities, characterized by nodes (individual elements) and edges (connections between elements). Two particularly significant network structures are scale-free networks and small-world networks. Scale-free networks follow a power law degree distribution, where a small number of nodes have many connections while most nodes have few. Small-world networks combine high clustering with short average path lengths, allowing efficient information or resource flow.

## Examples
- **Nature**: 
  - Neural networks in brains
  - Protein interaction networks
  - Ecological food webs
  - River systems and watersheds
- **Communities**: 
  - Social media connections
  - Knowledge-sharing networks
  - Forum discussions that self-organize by topic
  - Collaboration patterns in open-source projects
- **Organizations**: 
  - Formal and informal communication networks
  - Supply chain structures
  - Cross-departmental project teams
  - Mentorship networks
- **Society**:
  - Transportation networks (highways, flight patterns)
  - Academic citation networks
  - Economic trade networks
  - Power grids and utility distribution

## Underlying Mechanisms
- Preferential attachment (new connections are made preferentially to more popular nodes)
- Growth and addition of new nodes over time
- Homophily (similar nodes tend to connect)
- Resource optimization (networks often evolve to efficiently distribute resources)
- Triadic closure (friends of friends tend to become friends)
- Self-organization through local interactions

## Potential Applications
- **System Design**: Creating robust, efficient networks that can withstand random failures
- **Organization Design**: Building team structures that optimize information flow
- **Community Building**: Developing platforms that facilitate efficient connection formation
- **Crisis Management**: Identifying key nodes for intervention in spreading processes
- **Innovation**: Creating networks that balance clustering (for deep collaboration) with bridging (for new ideas)
- **Resource Distribution**: Optimizing distribution networks for energy, information, or materials
