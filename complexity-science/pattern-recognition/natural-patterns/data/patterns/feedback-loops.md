# Feedback Loops

## Domain(s)
- Nature (Physical Systems, Biological Systems)
- Communities (Small Group Dynamics, Cultural Patterns)
- Organizations (Team Dynamics, Growth Patterns)
- Society (Economic Patterns, Social Movements)

## Pattern Description
Feedback loops occur when the output or result of a process influences the input or starting conditions of that same process. Positive feedback amplifies changes (moving away from equilibrium), while negative feedback dampens changes (maintaining equilibrium).

## Examples
- **Nature**: 
  - Positive: Population growth, global warming, snowball effect in avalanches
  - Negative: Body temperature regulation, predator-prey relationships, ecosystem balance
- **Communities**: 
  - Positive: Social media "echo chambers," viral content spread
  - Negative: Community norms enforcement, self-policing mechanisms
- **Organizations**: 
  - Positive: Success reinforcement in high-performing teams, market dominance cycles
  - Negative: Quality control systems, budget constraints, performance review systems
- **Society**:
  - Positive: Economic bubbles, arms races, technology adoption curves
  - Negative: Market price equilibrium, democratic checks and balances, social norms

## Underlying Mechanisms
- Circular causality (outputs become inputs)
- Time delays between action and reaction
- Thresholds and tipping points
- Multiple interconnected loops (reinforcing and balancing)
- Information flow pathways

## Potential Applications
- **System Design**: Creating resilient systems with appropriate balancing feedback
- **Behavior Change**: Leveraging positive feedback to accelerate adoption of beneficial behaviors
- **Risk Management**: Identifying potential runaway (positive feedback) scenarios
- **Innovation**: Creating virtuous cycles of improvement and adoption
- **Conflict Resolution**: Breaking destructive feedback cycles by introducing new variables
