# Fractal Self-Similarity

## Domain(s)
- Nature (Physical Systems, Biological Systems)
- Communities (Online Communities, Cultural Patterns)
- Organizations (Team Structures, Communication Networks)
- Society (Urban Development, Social Networks)

## Pattern Description
Fractal self-similarity is a pattern where similar structures repeat at different scales. The whole contains parts that resemble the whole itself, creating a recursive pattern that maintains its fundamental characteristics across different levels of magnification or organization.

## Examples
- **Nature**: Fern leaves, tree branching patterns, river networks, coastlines, mountain ranges, lightning bolts
- **Communities**: Subgroups within larger communities that mirror the structure and dynamics of the parent community
- **Organizations**: Teams within departments within divisions, each with similar communication patterns and hierarchies
- **Society**: Neighborhood structures repeating across cities; social network clusters that mirror the properties of the entire network

## Underlying Mechanisms
- Recursive growth processes
- Simple rules applied repeatedly
- Optimization for resource distribution (e.g., maximizing surface area)
- Self-organizing criticality
- Power law distributions

## Potential Applications
- **Design**: Creating resilient, scalable systems by applying fractal principles
- **Organization**: Designing team structures that maintain efficiency at different scales
- **Urban Planning**: Developing more natural, functional city layouts
- **Problem Solving**: Breaking complex problems into self-similar smaller problems
- **Communication Networks**: Designing robust networks that maintain connectivity properties at different scales
