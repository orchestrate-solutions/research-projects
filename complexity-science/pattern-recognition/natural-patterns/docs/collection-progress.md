# Pattern Collection Progress

This document tracks our progress in collecting and documenting natural patterns across different domains.

## Patterns Documented (6/30)

1. ✅ [Fractal Self-Similarity](../data/patterns/fractal-self-similarity.md)
2. ✅ [Emergent Behavior](../data/patterns/emergent-behavior.md)
3. ✅ [Feedback Loops](../data/patterns/feedback-loops.md)
4. ✅ [Network Structure](../data/patterns/network-structure.md)
5. ✅ [Hierarchical Organization](../data/patterns/hierarchical-organization.md)
6. ✅ [Cyclical Patterns](../data/patterns/cyclical-patterns.md)

## Patterns Identified for Documentation (Next 4)

1. 📝 Resource Distribution - Power laws and preferential attachment
2. 📝 Adaptation and Evolution - Incremental change through selection pressures
3. 📝 Symbiosis and Mutualism - Cooperative relationships between entities
4. 📝 Boundaries and Interfaces - How systems interact at their edges

## Domain Coverage

| Domain        | Patterns | Examples | Coverage |
|---------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Nature        | 6        | 25+      | Good     |
| Communities   | 6        | 20+      | Good     |
| Organizations | 6        | 20+      | Good     |
| Society       | 6        | 20+      | Good     |

## Category Coverage

| Category     | Patterns | Examples | Coverage |
|--------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Structural   | 3        | 15+      | Medium   |
| Process      | 3        | 15+      | Medium   |
| Relationship | 0        | 0        | None     |
| Resilience   | 0        | 0        | None     |

## Pattern Relationships Identified

- Fractal Self-Similarity ↔ Network Structure ↔ Hierarchical Organization
- Emergent Behavior ↔ Feedback Loops ↔ Cyclical Patterns
- Network Structure ↔ Resource Distribution (to be documented)
- Hierarchical Organization ↔ Boundaries and Interfaces (to be documented)
- Cyclical Patterns ↔ Adaptation and Evolution (to be documented)

## Next Steps

1. Document the remaining 4 identified patterns
2. Focus on adding Relationship and Resilience pattern categories
3. Run the visualization script to map pattern relationships
4. Begin cross-domain comparison analysis
5. Identify potential meta-patterns emerging from the collection
