# Collection Phase Research Plan

## Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Initial pattern identification across domains
- **Week 3-4**: Detailed documentation of first 10 patterns
- **Week 5-6**: Review, refinement, and pattern relationship mapping
- **Week 7-8**: Secondary research to fill gaps and expand pattern collection

## Collection Goals
1. Identify at least 30 distinct patterns across all domains
2. Document each pattern according to the established template
3. Create at least 5 well-documented examples for each pattern
4. Establish preliminary relationships between patterns

## Focus Areas for Initial Collection
1. **Structural Patterns**: Physical organization and forms
   - Fractals and self-similarity
   - Network structures
   - Hierarchical organizations
   - Symmetry and asymmetry

2. **Process Patterns**: How things change over time
   - Growth and decay cycles
   - Feedback loops
   - Adaptation and evolution
   - Emergence and self-organization

3. **Relationship Patterns**: How elements interact
   - Cooperation and competition
   - Symbiosis and parasitism
   - Information flow
   - Resource allocation

4. **Resilience Patterns**: How systems maintain stability
   - Redundancy and diversity
   - Adaptive capacity
   - Threshold behaviors
   - Response to perturbations

## Research Methods
1. **Literature Review**
   - Academic journals across relevant disciplines
   - Books on systems thinking, complexity, and pattern recognition
   - Case studies in organizational behavior and social systems

2. **Direct Observation**
   - Natural settings (parks, gardens, wilderness areas)
   - Community gatherings and interactions
   - Organizational environments (with permission)
   - Public spaces and urban environments

3. **Data Analysis**
   - Existing datasets on natural systems
   - Social network analyses
   - Organizational studies
   - Urban planning and development data

## Documentation Process
1. Create initial pattern draft using template
2. Collect at least 3 examples from different domains
3. Research underlying mechanisms
4. Identify potential applications
5. Peer review by project members
6. Refine and finalize documentation

## Weekly Check-in Questions
1. How many new patterns were identified this week?
2. What domains are underrepresented in our current collection?
3. What interesting connections between patterns have emerged?
4. What challenges in pattern documentation need to be addressed?
5. What resources or expertise would help advance the collection phase?
