# Gravity-Flow Engine

## Vision
Transform static logical structures (flowcharts, process maps, pattern chains) into dynamic, self-organizing systems using physics-based principles. This project aims to create a unification layer where patterns can be visualized as living, interacting systems rather than static diagrams.

## Core Concept
Reframe traditional flowcharts as force-directed graphs where:
- Nodes have physical properties (mass, charge, inertia)
- Edges represent logical relationships with physical properties (strength, elasticity)
- The system self-organizes based on these properties and their interactions

## Potential Applications
- Pattern Relationship Visualization
- Process Optimization
- System Behavior Modeling
- Emergent Properties Analysis
- Risk and Failure Point Identification
- Decision Tree Optimization

## Project Structure
- `/src` - Source code for the engine
- `/docs` - Documentation and design specifications
- `/research` - Research on visualization libraries and related concepts
- `/examples` - Example implementations and use cases

## Goals
1. Research and evaluate existing graph visualization libraries
2. Develop a mapping system between logical constructs and physical properties
3. Create a flexible API for defining and customizing system behavior
4. Build visualization prototypes with different use cases
5. Analyze emergent properties and insights from dynamic visualizations

## Mapping Flowchart Semantics to Physics

| Flow Element         | Force Property Equivalent                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Start Node           | High repulsion (stays at edge or top)         |
| End Node             | High attraction sink (low potential well)     |
| Conditional (if)     | Mass = entropy \| Charge = logic pressure     |
| Loop (for/while)     | Circular pull + orbiting dynamics             |
| Parallel Processes   | Repel each other, maintain lateral spacing    |
| Data Transfer        | Link strength = bandwidth, delay = damping    |
| Bottlenecks          | Node congestion = simulated tension           |
| Decision Hubs        | High mass = gravity attractor                 |

## Technology Candidates
