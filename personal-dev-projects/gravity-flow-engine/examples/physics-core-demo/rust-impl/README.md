# Gravity Flow Engine - Rust Physics Implementation

This is a Rust implementation of the Gravity Flow Engine physics core. It provides the same functionality as the JavaScript version but with the performance and memory safety benefits of Rust.

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (rustc, cargo) - [Install from rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)

## Building and Running

1. Navigate to the rust-impl directory:

```bash
cd personal-dev-projects/gravity-flow-engine/examples/physics-core-demo/rust-impl
```

2. Build and run the project:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

The `--release` flag enables optimizations which significantly improves performance for math-heavy calculations.

## Project Structure

- `src/physics_engine.rs` - Core physics implementation including force calculations and integration
- `src/main.rs` - Entry point that sets up the test pattern network and runs the simulation

## Performance Considerations

The Rust implementation offers several advantages for physics calculations:

1. **Memory safety** - Rust's ownership system ensures no dangling references or data races
2. **Performance** - Rust compiles to highly optimized native code, ideal for math-heavy operations
3. **Type safety** - Strongly typed system catches many errors at compile time
4. **Concurrency potential** - Rust's threading model makes it easier to parallelize physics calculations (future work)

## Comparison with JavaScript

Both implementations provide the same functionality, but the Rust version:

- Runs significantly faster, especially for larger networks
- Uses less memory due to more efficient data structures
- Can be extended to use multi-threading for parallel computation
- Requires compilation before running (vs. JavaScript's interpret-and-run model)

## Next Steps

- Implement multi-threading for parallel force calculations
- Create a high-performance WebAssembly (WASM) version that can run in browsers
- Add spatial partitioning optimizations (quadtree/octree) for large networks
