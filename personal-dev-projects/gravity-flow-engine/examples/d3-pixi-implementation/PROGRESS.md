# Gravity Flow Engine - D3 + PixiJS Implementation Progress

## 🚀 Project Overview
This document tracks the progress of implementing the Gravity Flow Engine using D3-force for physics simulation and PixiJS for high-performance rendering.

## ✅ Completed Components

### 📊 Core Files
- [x] `package.json` - Project configuration and dependencies
- [x] `index.html` - Main HTML entry point with UI elements
- [x] `index.js` - Main entry point to integrate components (COMPLETED)

### 🧩 Core Architecture
- [x] `physics-engine.js` - D3-force based physics simulation 
- [x] `rendering-layer.js` - PixiJS rendering implementation
- [x] `simulation-layer.js` - Physics simulation interface layer
- [x] `simulation-engine.js` - Additional physics engine for pattern simulation
- [x] `pattern-data-model.js` - Data structure for patterns and relationships
- [x] `pattern-manager.js` - Manages patterns, categories, filtering
- [x] `render-engine.js` - Core rendering engine (may be redundant with rendering-layer.js)

### 📝 Documentation
- [x] Technical architecture document
- [x] Pattern-to-physics mapping documentation
- [x] Progress tracking document

## 🔄 In Progress
- [ ] `data-model.js` - Additional data model functionality
- [ ] Integration testing between physics and rendering components
- [ ] Performance optimization for large graphs

## 📋 To Do
- [ ] Build a simple configuration UI
- [ ] Add export/import functionality for saving/loading graphs
- [ ] Implement pattern searching and filtering
- [ ] Add examples showcasing different pattern types
- [ ] Add adaptive performance modes for different device capabilities

## 🐛 Known Issues
- Potential redundancy between `render-engine.js` and `rendering-layer.js`
- Need to ensure consistent data flow between physics and rendering layers
- Need to implement viewport synchronization for panning/zooming

## 🔍 Next Steps
1. Test the integration between all components with the new index.js file
2. Fix any issues with method signatures or data format incompatibilities
3. Implement basic UI controls for adjusting simulation parameters
4. Add pattern filtering functionality
5. Test with larger datasets to measure performance
