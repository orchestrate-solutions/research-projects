## Conclusion

For the Gravity Flow Engine, a hybrid approach using D3-force with PixiJS provides the best balance of physics customization (crucial for pattern properties) and rendering performance. This pairing allows customized physics on a per-pattern basis while still handling thousands of nodes with good performance.

If the system needs to scale to very large pattern collections, transitioning to ngraph.forcelayout with Sigma.js would provide better performance but would require more custom integration work.
